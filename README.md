Charmander Heapster
===================

A slimmed-down version of [Google's Heapster](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/heapster) project used as part of the [Charmander Scheduler Lab Environment](https://github.com/att-innovate/charmander).

This version contains additional source code to communicate with Redis, Charmander's Task-Intelligence datastore.
